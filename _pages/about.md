Hello, I’m Zhennan Wan, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Tsinghua University. My current research focuses on multi-agent collaboration in large language models (LLMs), with broader interests in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

**I am currently searching for suitable summer research opportunities**

You can contact me through email zhennan018@gmail.com. You can also visit my GitHub website https://github.com/zhennan1 to learn more about the projects I have worked on before.

I’m excited to share my interests and academic pursuits here, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with like-minded individuals. 🌐🎵🚶‍♂️💤🎮
