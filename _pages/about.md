Hello, I’m Zhennan Wan, a 20-year-old male born on September 4, 2004. I’m currently a third-year student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, focusing on multi-agent research. I’m passionate about computer science, especially in the areas of NLP, ML, AI

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing badminton and table tennis, which provide me with energy and joy. Additionally, I love listening to music, chatting, sleeping, and playing video games like Honor of Kings and Counter-Strike 2 to unwind and maintain a balanced life. 

I’m excited to share my interests and academic pursuits here, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with like-minded individuals. 🌐🎵🚶‍♂️💤🎮
