Hello, I’m Zhennan Wan, a 20-year-old male born on September 4, 2004. I’m currently a third-year student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, focusing on multi-agent research. I’m passionate about computer science, especially in the areas of machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, etc.

**I am currently searching for suitable summer research opportunities**

You can contact me through email zhennan018@gmail.com. You can also visit my GitHub website https://github.com/zhennan1 to learn more about the projects I have worked on before.

I’m excited to share my interests and academic pursuits here, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with like-minded individuals. 🌐🎵🚶‍♂️💤🎮
