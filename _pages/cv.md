**Education**

<!-- * Ph.D in Version Control Theory, GitHub University, 2018 (expected) -->
<!-- * M.S. in Jekyll, GitHub University, 2014 -->
* B.S. in Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, 2026 (expected)

**Research Experience**

* July 2023 - August 2023: Research Intern
  * State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University
  * Supervisor: Assistant Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5G47IcIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Bin Fang</a>
  * Description: Trained neural network models to extract human hand movements from electromyographic signals of the human arm.

* February 2024 - August 2024: Research Intern
  * 3D Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence (3DVICI) Lab, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University
  * Supervisor: Assistant Professor <a href="https://ericyi.github.io/">Li Yi</a>
  * Description: Utilized video editing techniques to convert human hand-object interaction videos into robotic hand-object interaction videos; extracted 6D poses of human videos; compared human data with robot data, referencing pipelines such as OpenVLA, to validate the effectiveness of human videos for robotic training

* September 2024 - Now: Research Intern
  * Natural Language Processing Lab, Tsinghua University (THUNLP)
  * Supervisor: Associate Professor <a href="https://lpeng.net/">Peng Li</a> and Professor <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/">Yang Liu</a>
  * Description: Developed a multi-agent framework, ScalableExtAgents, for question-answering tasks requiring large amounts of external knowledge. The framework distributes external knowledge across multiple agents and facilitates intensive inter-agent communication, 
overcoming the context window limitations of current large language models (LLMs). Experimental results show that this method effectively 
handles vast knowledge inputs, with performance on par with or surpassing traditional methods, while achieving higher parallelism and 
scalability for complex applications. Project website: <a href="https://github.com/zhennan1/ScalableExtAgents">https://github.com/zhennan1/ScalableExtAgents</a>
