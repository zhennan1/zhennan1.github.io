**Research Experience**

* **September 2024 - May 2025: Natural Language Processing Lab, Tsinghua University (THUNLP)**
  * Supervisor: Associate Professor [Peng Li](https://lpeng.net/) and Professor [Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/)
  * Research Topic: Scaling External Knowledge Input Beyond the Context Length of LLMs via Multi-Agent Collaboration (In submission to NeurIPS 2025)
  * Role: Co-leader, Co-first author
  * Description: Developed a multi-agent framework, ExtAgents, to overcome the context window limitations of current large language models (LLMs) and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471). Project website: [https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/ExtAgents](https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/ExtAgents). Data: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhennan1/ExtAgents](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhennan1/ExtAgents). Downloads last month: 123

* **February 2024 - August 2024: 3D Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence (3DVICI) Lab, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University**
  * Supervisor: Assistant Professor [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/)
  * Research Topic: Editing Human Videos for Robotic Skill Training
  * Role: Co-leader
  * Description: Utilized video editing techniques to convert human hand-object interaction videos into robotic hand-object interaction videos; extracted 6D poses of human videos; compared human data with robot data, referencing pipelines such as OpenVLA, to validate the effectiveness of human videos for robotic training.

* **July 2023 - August 2023: State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University**
  * Supervisor: Assistant Professor [Bin Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5G47IcIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)
  * Research Topic: Human-Machine Collaborative Operation of Super-functional Prosthetic Hands
  * Role: Project Member
  * Description: Trained neural network models to extract human hand movements from electromyographic signals of the human arm.

**Internship Experience**

* **June 2025 - Present: Code Intelligence Center, Technology and Engineering Group (TEG), Tencent**
  * Project Topic: Applying CodeLLMs for Multi-Point Code Completion and Smart Rewriting
  * Role: Student Leader
  * Description: Investigated data synthesis algorithms for Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) specifically for multi-point code completion and intelligent rewrite tasks. Trained a CodeLLM-based Fusion Model for multi-point completion to enable multi-point navigation and provide intelligent rewrite suggestions within code editing scenarios.

**Course Project**

* **April 2025 - June 2025: Frontiers in AI safety and Governance (2025 Spring)**
  * Lecturer: Professor [Peng Cui](https://pengcui.thumedialab.com/)
  * Project Topic: Adaptive Safety Priming: Inference-Time Safeguards for Large Reasoning Models
  * Role: Independent
  * Description: Developed a lightweight and dynamic safety mechanism, Adaptive Safety Priming (ASP), for large reasoning models (LRM) at inference time, which leverages their step-by-step inference process to enable real-time intervention. This approach provides a more adaptive and resource efficient path to develop robustly safe models. [Report](https://github.com/zhennan1/ASP/blob/main/Report.pdf)
